        <div className={styles.description}>
          Hello, my name is Adel Kouaou and I am studying computer-science at 
         <span> <a href="https://www.cegepmontpetit.ca/"> Cegep&nbsp;Edouard-montpetit</a></span>.
          My interest in software development started when I realised I enjoy
          creating & troubleshooting things in general, turns out coding fits
          the description perfectly! Outside of coding, I also love gaming and
          the competitive side of it. The satisfaction of growing as a player
          and the sense of contributing to a team and community are the reasons
          im passionned by gaming.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my free time I put a lot of effort into creating my own projects in an attempt to expand my knowledge in this domain.
          I thrive in a team environment and am equally productive when given a task to complete on my own. My main focus these days
          is to keep learning and stay up to date with the newest technologies.
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>Here are a few ones Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
          <ul className={styles.skills}>
            {skills.map((skill,i)=>(<li key={i}>{skill}</li>))}
          </ul>
        </div>


        {/* TODO: try to use Next.Js optimized Image component instead */}
